## Installation

Install the latest version of the IDA Pro MCP package:

```sh
pip uninstall ida-pro-mcp
pip install https://github.com/mrexodia/ida-pro-mcp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```

Configure the MCP servers and install the IDA Plugin:

```
ida-pro-mcp --install
```

**Important**: Make sure you completely restart IDA and your MCP client for the installation to take effect. Some clients (like Claude) run in the background and need to be quit from the tray icon.

## Prompt Engineering

LLMs are prone to hallucinations and you need to be specific with your prompting. For reverse engineering the conversion between integers and bytes are especially problematic. Below is a minimal example prompt, feel free to start a discussion or open an issue if you have good results with a different prompt:

```md
Your task is to analyze a crackme in IDA Pro. You can use the MCP tools to retrieve information. In general use the following strategy:

- Inspect the decompilation and add comments with your findings
- Rename variables to more sensible names
- Change the variable and argument types if necessary (especially pointer and array types)
- Change function names to be more descriptive
- If more details are necessary, disassemble the function and add comments with your findings
- NEVER convert number bases yourself. Use the `int_convert` MCP tool if needed!
- Do not attempt brute forcing, derive any solutions purely from the disassembly and simple python scripts
- Create a report.md with your findings and steps taken at the end
- When you find a solution, prompt to user for feedback with the password you found
```

This prompt was just the first experiment, please share if you found ways to improve the output!

Another prompt by [@can1357](https://github.com/can1357):

```md
Your task is to create a complete and comprehensive reverse engineering analysis. Reference AGENTS.md to understand the project goals and ensure the analysis serves our purposes.

Use the following systematic methodology:

1. **Decompilation Analysis**
   - Thoroughly inspect the decompiler output
   - Add detailed comments documenting your findings
   - Focus on understanding the actual functionality and purpose of each component (do not rely on old, incorrect comments)

2. **Improve Readability in the Database**
   - Rename variables to sensible, descriptive names
   - Correct variable and argument types where necessary (especially pointers and array types)
   - Update function names to be descriptive of their actual purpose

3. **Deep Dive When Needed**
   - If more details are necessary, examine the disassembly and add comments with findings
   - Document any low-level behaviors that aren't clear from the decompilation alone
   - Use sub-agents to perform detailed analysis

4. **Important Constraints**
   - NEVER convert number bases yourself - use the int_convert MCP tool if needed
   - Use MCP tools to retrieve information as necessary
   - Derive all conclusions from actual analysis, not assumptions

5. **Documentation**
   - Produce comprehensive RE/*.md files with your findings
   - Document the steps taken and methodology used
   - When asked by the user, ensure accuracy over previous analysis file
   - Organize findings in a way that serves the project goals outlined in AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md
```

## Tips for Enhancing LLM Accuracy

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools, but they can sometimes struggle with complex mathematical calculations or exhibit "hallucinations" (making up facts). Make sure to tell the LLM to use the `int_convert` MCP tool and you might also need [math-mcp](https://github.com/EthanHenrickson/math-mcp) for certain operations.

Another thing to keep in mind is that LLMs will not perform well on obfuscated code. Before trying to use an LLM to solve the problem, take a look around the binary and spend some time (automatically) removing the following things:

- String encryption
- Import hashing
- Control flow flattening
- Code encryption
- Anti-decompilation tricks

You should also use a tool like Lumina or FLIRT to try and resolve all the open source library code and the C++ STL, this will further improve the accuracy.

## SSE Transport & Headless MCP

You can run an SSE server to connect to the user interface like this:

```sh
uv run ida-pro-mcp --transport http://127.0.0.1:8744/sse
```

After installing [`idalib`](https://docs.hex-rays.com/user-guide/idalib) you can also run a headless SSE server:

```sh
uv run idalib-mcp --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8745 path/to/executable
```

_Note_: The `idalib` feature was contributed by [Willi Ballenthin](https://github.com/williballenthin).

### 🔐 Authentication for Remote Deployments

**IMPORTANT**: When deploying IDA Pro MCP on a remote server, **anyone who can access the port can control IDA Pro**. To secure your deployment:

```sh
# Generate a strong token
TOKEN=$(python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))")

# Start server with authentication
uv run ida-pro-mcp --transport http://0.0.0.0:8744/sse --auth-token "$TOKEN"

# Or for headless mode
uv run idalib-mcp --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8745 --auth-token "$TOKEN" /path/to/binary
```

Clients must include the token in the `Authorization` header:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://server:8744/sse
```

For IDA plugin (running inside IDA Pro), configure authentication via:
- Web UI: `http://localhost:13337/config.html` (set token, click Save)
- Environment variable: `export IDA_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN="your-token"`

See [AUTHENTICATION.md](AUTHENTICATION.md) for detailed security configuration guide.



## MCP Resources

**Key Features:**

- **Type-safe API**: All functions use strongly-typed parameters with TypedDict schemas for better IDE support and LLM structured outputs
- **Batch-first design**: Most operations accept both single items and lists
- **Consistent error handling**: All batch operations return `[{..., error: null|string}, ...]`
- **Cursor-based pagination**: Search functions return `cursor: {next: offset}` or `{done: true}` (default limit: 1000, enforced max: 10000 to prevent token overflow)
- **Performance**: Strings are cached with MD5-based invalidation to avoid repeated `build_strlist` calls in large projects

## Comparison with other MCP servers

There are a few IDA Pro MCP servers floating around, but I created my own for a few reasons:

1. Installation should be fully automated.
2. The architecture of other plugins make it difficult to add new functionality quickly (too much boilerplate of unnecessary dependencies).
3. Learning new technologies is fun!

If you want to check them out, here is a list (in the order I discovered them):

- https://github.com/taida957789/ida-mcp-server-plugin (SSE protocol only, requires installing dependencies in IDAPython).
- https://github.com/fdrechsler/mcp-server-idapro (MCP Server in TypeScript, excessive boilerplate required to add new functionality).
- https://github.com/MxIris-Reverse-Engineering/ida-mcp-server (custom socket protocol, boilerplate).

Feel free to open a PR to add your IDA Pro MCP server here.

## Development

Adding new features is a super easy and streamlined process. All you have to do is add a new `@tool` function to the modular API files in `src/ida_pro_mcp/ida_mcp/api_*.py` and your function will be available in the MCP server without any additional boilerplate! Below is a video where I add the `get_metadata` function in less than 2 minutes (including testing):

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/951de823-88ea-4235-adcb-9257e316ae64

To test the MCP server itself:

```sh
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

This will open a web interface at http://localhost:5173 and allow you to interact with the MCP tools for testing.

For testing I create a symbolic link to the IDA plugin and then POST a JSON-RPC request directly to `http://localhost:13337/mcp`. After [enabling symbolic links](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) you can run the following command:

```sh
uv run ida-pro-mcp --install
```

Generate the changelog of direct commits to `main`:

```sh
git log --first-parent --no-merges 1.2.0..main "--pretty=- %s"
```
